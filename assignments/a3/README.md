## Repo structure

```bash

```

## Data Source and Prerequisites


The main script was written and executed using ```Python v.1.89.1```. 
For the processing and analysis of the data, the following packages were used:

```

```

## Reproducing the Analysis:

To reproduce the analysis, change directory to *a3* and run *setup.sh* from the from the terminal:
```bash
cd a3
bash setup.sh
``` 
*run.sh* performs the following actions:
1. Sets up a virtual environment called *.venv* in the root directory using ```venv```:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
2. Activates the environment:
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Fetches and installs required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
