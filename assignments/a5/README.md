## Repo structure

```bash

```

## Data Source and Prerequisites
Data source is my own code 

The main script was written and executed using ```Python v.1.89.1```. 
For the processing and analysis of the data, the following packages were used:

```
codecarbon
```

## Reproducing the Analysis:
Insert notebook

## Key Points from the Outputs:
Insert tables

- Which assignment generated the most emissions in terms of CO₂eq? Explain why this might be.
- Which specific tasks generated the most emissions in terms of CO₂eq? Again, explain why this might be.
- How robust do you think these results are and how/where might they be improved? 

## Discussion of Limitations and Possible Steps to Improvement
